Alternatively you can place the dough (and the small container of very hot water) in a microwave oven (not turned on) or a standard oven without a pilot light, but with the oven light turned on to provide gentle heat.\n•If you want to make this bread over a 2-day period, you can refrigerate it overnight after the first rise. Once it has doubled in size (first rise), gently press the dough down in the bowl, then transfer to a large, re-sealable freezer bag that's been coated with vegetable oil or nonstick vegetable-oil spray. Leave a small end of the bag unsealed to allow for gas to escape during fermentation and refrigerate the dough overnight. The next day, bring the dough to room temperature at least 1 hour before shaping and baking the loaf.\n•For proper texture, it's important for the bread to get a blast of heat as soon as it goes into the oven. For this reason, the oven needs to be preheated for a full hour, and it's important not to let too much heat escape when you put the bread in. When transferring the dough to the oven to bake, be sure to shut the door quickly."},{"step":10,"instruction":"Flour: 100%\nWater: 70.6%\nYeast: 0.81%\nSalt: 1.8%\nOil: 1.1%"}]},{"id":8440,"name":"Chewy Amaretti Sandwich Cookies","ratings":"3.5","ratingsClass":9,"reviewCount":"23","recipeURL":"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chewy-amaretti-sandwich-cookies-351209","ingredient":[{"name":"Tube Pure Almond Paste","amount":1,"unit":""},{"name":"Sugar","amount":1,"unit":"cup"},{"name":"Egg Whites At Room Temperature Minutes","amount":32,"unit":"large"},{"name":"Pastry With Plain Tip","amount":0,"unit":"bag"}],"originalIngredient":["1 (7-ounce) tube pure almond paste (not marzipan; 3/4 cup)","1 cup sugar","2 large egg whites at room temperature for 30 minutes","a pastry bag with a 3/8-inch plain tip"],"recipeImageURL":"https://assets.epicurious.com/photos/58485a8cbbf20a4f3a3e55fa/6:4/w_274%2Ch_169/chewy-amarreti-cookies_07122016.jpg","additionalInfo":[{"heading":"Yield","body":"Makes about 4 dozen"},{"heading":"Active Time","body":"20 min"},{"heading":"Total Time","body":"1 hr"}],"prepInstructions":[{"step":1,"instruction":"Preheat oven to 300°F with racks in upper and lower thirds.
