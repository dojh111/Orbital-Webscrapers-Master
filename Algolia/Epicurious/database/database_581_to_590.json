Pecorino fresco is a fresh sheep' smilk cheese that is milder in taste and softer than Pecorino Toscano or Pecorino Romano. Look for pecorino fresco at your local cheese shop or purchase it online from murrays cheese.com or agferrari.com. Manchego cheese, which is also made from sheep's milk, is a good substitute.\nWhat to drink: In keeping with the spirit of this menu, pour Tuscan wines. Try a Tuscan white with the pizza.
