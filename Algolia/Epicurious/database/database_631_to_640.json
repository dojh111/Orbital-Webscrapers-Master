The findings are frustrating because there seems to be no collective information as to how many eggs are infected, and how many people have been stricken with salmonella in this country, so there is no way of knowing the degree of risk one is taking when eating raw or lightly cooked eggs, which are used in many recipes. Government officials recommend that immuno-compromised patients, the very young and the elderly, all of whom are the most severely affected when stricken, should not eat raw or lightly cooked eggs. Until the problem has been licked, the rest of us are consuming eggs that have not been cooked to 165° at our own risk.
