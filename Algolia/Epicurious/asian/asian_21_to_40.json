        "instruction": "Peel and pit the avocado, rubbing it with the lemon juice, and cut it into 1/4-inch-thick strips. Heat the nori in a preheated 350°F. oven for 10 minutes, or until it is softened slightly, and keep it warm. Working with one sheet of nori at a time and with a long side facing you, spread about 3/4 cup of the rice in an even layer on each sheet, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the long sides. Arrange some of the avocado strips horizontally across the middle of the rice and arrange some of the cucumber strips and the crab meat on top of the avocado. Dab the crab meat with the wasabi and beginning with a long side roll up the nori tightly jelly-roll fashion. Cut each roll with a sharp knife into 3/4-inch-thick slices and serve the rolls with the soy sauce, the additional wasabi, and the ginger."

Spread a rounded tablespoon of the filling down the long side, leaving a 2-inch border at each end, and brush the edges with some of the egg wash. Fold the corners of the long side over the filling and, rolling away from you, roll up the filling in the wrapper, sealing the roll, using some of the remaining egg wash if necessary. Make more spring rolls with the remaining filling, wrappers, and egg wash in the same manner, transferring them as they are made to a wax-paper-lined baking sheet and keeping them covered with plastic wrap. In a deep fryer heat 1 1/4 inches of the oil to 375°F. on a deep-fat thermometer and in it fry the spring rolls in batches, turning them, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are golden, transferring them as they are fried with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. The spring rolls may be made 5 days in advance, cooled completely, and kept frozen in plastic freezer bags. Reheat the rolls, unthawed, on a rack set in a shallow baking pan in a preheated 450°F. oven for 10 minutes."
