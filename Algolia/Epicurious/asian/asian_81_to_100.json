Add choy sum, bean sprouts, and scallions and stir-fry until choy sum is crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in broth mixture and bring to a boil. Add noodles and gently stir-fry until heated through and noodles are tender. Return sausage and chicken to wok and stir-fry until chicken is just cooked through, about 1 minute.

Repeat with the remaining leaves. Stack the leaf halves, about 6 at a time, one on top of the other, and roll them into a tight log. Thinly slice the log crosswise; you will end up with long, slender shreds. When cutting the kale, you can’t help notice how strong smelling and grassy it is (no wonder I love the smell of fresh-mowed grass in the summer). Dunk the shreds into the bowl of water to rinse off any grit, then scoop the shreds out and drain them in a colander. Repeat once or twice if the kale does not appear clean."

        "step": 4,
        "instruction": "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil appears to shimmer, add the turmeric-smeared fillet to the skillet. The instant sizzle and sear will turn the salmon light brown on the underside, about 2 minutes. Turn it over and repeat with the second side, about 2 minutes. Transfer the fish to a plate. Add the garlic to the skillet and stir-fry it until light brown and aromatic, about 1 minute."
      },

        "step": 5,
        "instruction": "Pour the vinegar-based spice slurry into the skillet and stir to mix with the garlic. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes. The pungency will slap you in the face (in a good way—I promise) and the liquid will release all the browned bits of fish from the bottom of the skillet into the thin sauce."

Even though it grows all through the year, we often associate kale with cold weather, that brightness among a sea of white, very much like the evergreen Christmas tree. Curly, ornamental (those tight bases of light purple leaves with a frizzy head of green), or Russian kale—all varieties work well for this recipe. Bursting with antioxidants, vitamins A and C, and iron, kale is a nutritional powerhouse among a sea of greens. Its tough leaves make it harder to cook than some greens, but with the right amount of moisture, it turns tender within about 5 minutes."

        "instruction": "To grind the chiles de árbol, pulverize them in a spice grinder (like a coffee grinder) until they are the texture of finely ground black pepper. The heat from freshly ground dried chiles is much more intense than preground cayenne."
      },
      {
        "step": 11,
        "instruction": "Before opening a can of coconut milk, shake it well to make sure the thick milk gets dispersed evenly. If the can sits around unopened, the thicker part usually floats to the top and congeals into a creamy mass. If shaking does nothing (usually if the can has been sitting in a cool spot, this will happen), then once you open the can, scrape the contents into a small bowl, and whisk the thicker milk with the wheylike separated liquid to create an evenly thick milk."

If any rice hulls or small twigs float to the surface, scoop them aside with your hand and discard them. Gently swirl your fingers through the rice until the water becomes cloudy with the rice's surface starch, about 20 seconds. Be careful not to massage the rice aggressively—you don't want to crack or break the grains. Allow the rice to settle for a few seconds. Tilt the pot over a sink and drain out all the water, cupping the rice with your hand to prevent it from spilling out of the pot. Repeat this process with three more changes of water. The water after the first 2 rinses will be quite cloudy; by the fourth rinse, it will be much less so. The water need not run completely clear by the final rinse—slightly cloudy is fine. Leave the rinsed rice in the pot."

Allow the rice to boil vigorously for fifteen seconds, continuing to stir constantly. (It's essential that you stir constantly, otherwise the fats and proteins in the coconut milk will cause the rice at the bottom of the pot to become gummy and stick together, which will ultimately lead to the final dish having a scorched or burned bottom layer.) Immediately reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting and cover the pot tightly with the lid. Continue cooking for 15 minutes. Don't be tempted to lift or remove the lid during this time—you'll lose essential cooking steam if you do."

Peel the outer layers of each stalk until you reach the tender center. Thinly slice the stalks into coins, then very finely mince. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the pork, fish sauce, salt, sugar, and white pepper and mix to combine. Roll into 1 1/2-inch meatballs and set on a rimmed baking sheet. The meatballs can be made beforehand; transfer to a lidded container or tightly wrap the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until ready to use but no longer than 24 hours."

As the oil heats, the shallots will begin to sizzle and bubble; fry, stirring frequently for even cooking, until the shallots begin to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until they are an even golden brown and crisp (at this stage, they can go from nicely browned to acrid and overcooked very quickly, so be vigilant). Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the shallots to the paper-towel- lined plate. Let the oil cool, then pour through a fine- mesh sieve into a clean jar. (Do not discard the oil; it’s liquid gold, great for another batch of fried shallots or to add flavor to dressings and sautéed vegetables, and you can also use it to make a batch of aioli.) The fried shallots can be made in advance. Let cool, then store in an airtight container at room temperature. Resist snacking on them; they'll keep for about a week."

Let the tamarind pulp rest until it softens, 10 to 15 minutes. Squeeze and massage the softened tamarind pulp through your fingers, loosening the fruit's soft auburn-colored pulp from the shiny black seeds, brittle brown skin shards, and sinewy bits of string. With your fingers, remove all the solid pieces from the liquid and discard them; all that will remain is a thick caramel-colored extract. Set the tamarind extract aside."

Pulse until you have a smooth paste the consistency of creamy mashed potatoes. (If the paste does not purée properly and repeatedly creeps up the side of the food processor instead of grinding, add up to 2 tablespoons of water, 1 tablespoon at a time, periodically turning the processor off and, with a spoon, scraping the unground portions down toward the blade as you go.)

        "instruction": "6. Thread the beef strips onto the presoaked bamboo skewers, weaving the point of each skewer through the center of the beef every 1/4 inch to make sure it holds tight and remains secure while it cooks. Use 1 to 4 pieces of beef per skewer, depending on how long the pieces are, making sure that the beef extends from the tip to the middle of the skewer. Leave plenty of room so you can grab the skewer at the bottom — the meat should not extend from one end to the other."

When the fire is hot (this may take up to 20 minutes), place each skewer on the grill, making sure that the beef, not the skewer, is directly over the heat. Grill the beef until it is cooked through and has begun to pick up a few crispy brown-black spots, about 2 to 5 minutes (depending on how hot the fire is). Turn the skewers over carefully and continue grilling until the other side is browned, another 2 to 5 minutes. Do not overcook the meat — it will dry out if you do. Test a piece by touching it with your finger. The beef should be firm, not squishy. Another way to test it is by cutting into the thickest point: It should be very faintly pink, neither blood-red nor gray."

Line a half-sheet pan with aluminum foil. Place each skewer on the pan, arranging them so that the meat is in the center of the pan and the skewers slightly hang over the outside, and slide the pan into the broiler. Broil until the meat begins to turn golden brown and develops a few char spots, about 5 to 6 minutes. Turn each piece over to brown the other side, an additional 5 to 6 minutes of broiling. Test a piece by touching it with your finger. The beef should be firm, not squishy. Another way to test it is by cutting into the thickest point: It should be very faintly pink, neither blood-red nor gray. If the surface doesn't char (your broiler or the distance from the flame may not allow it to), don't worry — as long as the meat is cooked through, the satay will taste wonderful. Do not overcook the meat; it will be unpleasantly dry."

Press the ball lightly but firmly, both to flatten it into a round pillow and simultaneously to coat the underside with flour. Turn and repeat, to coat the other side with flour. Pick up the patty with your fingers, shake it gently to release any excess flour, and place it on the work surface."

Those of you familiar with Mexican or Chinese cooking techniques will notice that the rolling of this bread is very similar to the rolling of the Mexican wheat flour tortilla or the Chinese pancakes that traditionally accompany Roast Peking Duck or \"Moo Shu\" dishes. (Bear in mind that this method of rolling is altogether different from the familiar technique used for pies, tarts, and quiches. There you position the rolling pin in the center and roll the dough away or twoard you, thus spreading and not stretching the dough.)"

Flip the bread, using a pair of unserated tongs, and bake the other side the same way. (Generally, when the griddle temperature is right, the first side of the bread will take about 20-30 seconds and the second side 8-10 seconds. But if it is too hot, the bread will brown too fast and burn before cooking.; if it is not hot enough, it will take too long to brown, by which time the bread will become dry, tough, and leathery. Therefore it is essential to check and keep the griddle at the right temperature at all times.)"

Repeat with the rest of the dough the same way. As the breads are baked, pile them one on top of the other in the dish. (The dish is lined because as more and more breads are piled in the dish, the steam from the breads begins to condense and accumulate at the bottom, which could cause the bottom few breads to be soft. The towel absorbs the moisture, preventing such a disaster.)"

When the oil is very hot and begins to smoke (400°F), drop one bread at a time into the oil. The bread will sink to the bottom. Immediately hold a slotted spoon flat over the bread, as though keeping it from rising, but not quite touching the bread. As the bread begins to sizzle and rise to the surface (about 3-5 seconds), press the bread very gently, as though patting it, for 2-3 seconds. This will puff the bread. Once the bread begins to puff up, be careful not to press the puffed part too hard, or the bread will break and oil will seep in. Let the bread cook until it stops sizzling and the underside is slightly brown. The entire process of puffing and cooking the first side should take about 15 seconds. Gently flip the bread, and let the other side cook about 15 seconds. Take it out, and drain it briefly on kitchen towels. Repeat with the rest of the rolled bread the same way. Serve immediately; or deflate them by placing them on the work surface and pressing gently, and put them in a covered dish or wrap in foil. Just before serving, warm them in a 300°F preheated oven for 15-20 minutes."

Poori is traditionally served with Tari Aloo (potatoes in fragrant gravy) in Aloo-Poori, or with Keema Matar (ground beef and chickpeas in cashew nut sauce) in Keema-Poori, a combination generally served for Sunday brunch. You can also serve these combinations at picnics and barbecue parties for an unusual yet delicious flavor. For such occasions, make the pooris ahead, deflate, and wrap them lightly in foil. Just before serving, place them, still wrapped in foil, near the charcoal grill or barbecue pit to heat them slightly."
