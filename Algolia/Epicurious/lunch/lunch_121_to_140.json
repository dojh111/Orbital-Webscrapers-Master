(The temperature of the shortening will drop when you add the chicken; try to maintain a temperature of 325°F.) Fry chicken until golden brown on all sides or until each piece reaches an internal temperature of 160°F, turning the chicken several times to prevent burned spots. This will take about 10 minutes for skinless breasts and 20 minutes for pieces with skin and bones. Drain cooked chicken on a rack, then keep warm in a 200°F oven while frying remaining chicken. Serve with chicken velouté."

        "instruction": "Prepare the matzo balls: Preheat the oven to 400°F. Cut off the fennel stalks and reserve for another use (excellent for fish broths and stews). If there are some attractive feathery fronds, set aside about 2 tablespoons of them to garnish the soup. Quarter the bulbs and trim away the stems, the bottom hard core, and any tough parts. Choose a shallow baking pan just large enough to fit the fennel in one layer and put in 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the fennel and toss until well coated. Roast the fennel until pale gold, about 20 minutes, then turn the fennel over and roast for 10 minutes longer. Stir in the broth, garlic, salt and pepper to taste, and 1/2 teaspoon of the thyme. Cover the pan with foil and cook for 35 to 45 minutes longer, or until the fennel is very soft. Remove the foil, stir, and roast for a few more minutes to evaporate most of the liquid. Transfer the fennel and garlic to a food processor and chop coarsely. Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of thyme, salt (it will need about 1 teaspoon), pepper to taste, and the fennel seeds, if using. With the machine on, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil through the feed tube."

If you can form a lump into a very soft walnut-size ball (the batter will become firmer when you chill it), don't add any more matzo meal. If necessary, add just enough matzo meal to enable you to do so. Refrigerate for at least 2 or up to 4 hours so the matzo meal can drink in the liquid and seasoning."

It should be light, fluffy and completely cooked through. If it isn't, continue cooking a few more minutes. Remove the balls gently with a skimmer or large slotted spoon—they are too fragile to pour into a colander."

Lower the heat to medium, add the butter to the mushrooms and stir until it has melted, then sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and stir constantly for about two minutes, so the flour is completely mixed into the mushrooms. Add the mushroom cooking liquid and stir until it is thoroughly blended with the ingredients in the pan and has begun to thicken, about 4 minutes. Stir in the crème fraîche and cook until it is thickened and completely incorporated into the ingredients and the mushrooms are tender though not completely limp, 4 to 5 minutes.

Repeat the process on the same band of dough, then repeat with all the ropes of dough so that you have four, flat bands. They will be irregular, but that is fine. When the greens are thoroughly cooked, tear 1-inch pieces off the first band of dough and throw them into the soup. Stir, then continue with the remaining band of dough. The dough is fairly soft, but it tears quite well, resulting in noodles that are irregularly shaped, just as Kunkhen's were."
