When the water begins to boil lift the garlic out of the water and into a bowl of ice water to quickly cool it. Repeat this twice, always starting with cold water in the saucepan. Peel the onion and cut in half, then cut into large chunks. Peel the cucumber. Cut in half, then into large pieces. Halve the bell peppers, then remove the seeds and white membranes. Chop the bell peppers, then aside along with the cucumber and onion. Cut the tomatoes into large wedges and put in a bowl with the onions, cucumbers, and bell peppers. Add the bread, torn into pieces, then pour over the water. Process everything together using a hand-held blender, or using a food processor. Strain the gazpacho through a fine-mesh strainer. Add the oil, vinegar, and mayonnaise, then whisk or blend the soup until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper. Chill in the fridge before serving (at least 2 hours). Serve the gazpacho in soup bowls with croutons, plus an extra drizzle of olive oil."

Wash the greens in several changes of the coldest possible water; tepid water might cause them to wilt, and you want them to stay as alert and perky as possible before being cooked. (Note: Because bok choi and baby bok choi tend to have pockets full of sand in the nooks where the leaves meet the center stem, be certain to pull the leaves back slightly away from the stem when you're cleaning them. There are few things worse than a mouthful of sand when you want a mouthful of greens.)"

If you're using baby bok choi or baby Shanghai choi, you can either leave the heads whole or cut them in half lengthwise — it's up to you. Spin the greens dry in a salad dryer or set them aside to air-dry on a kitchen towel or paper towels; they needn't be bone dry — a little dampness won't matter."

When it's hot but not smoking — it should appear shimmery — add the garlic, the salt, and, if using, the chiles. Sauté, stirring until the garlic just begins to lose its rawness, about 1 minute.

Continue to vigorously stir-fry the greens until they just begin to go limp but the leaves remain a spring-green color and the stems are still crunchy-crisp, 3 to 4 minutes, depending on the type of greens. Taste for salt, adding only a pinch more if necessary (a little salt goes a long way with greens)."
