This will ensure the meat cooks evenly. In a 3-quart saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the butter and 1/4 cup of the olive oil over medium heat until the butter is melted. Add the garlic and cook for 2 or 3 minutes, until just brown. Be careful to not burn the garlic—because if you do, you'll have to start all over. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, or until translucent. Add the thyme and carrot and cook until the latter is soft (about 5 minutes). Add the tomatoes and their juice and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring often. Lower the heat and simmer the mixture for 30 minutes, or until it begins to thicken. In a skillet placed over medium heat, add the remaining olive oil and butter and cook until the butter melts. Add the wine or beer and meatballs and cover with a lid. Cook for about 10 minutes, until the meatballs are no longer pink inside. (Depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to cook the meatballs in batches.) Plate the meatballs and cover with the tomato sauce. Top with freshly grated Parmesan to taste."

Dolcetto, a varietal common in the Piedmont, is wine for everyday drinking. It is often soft, round, fruit-driven and fragrant, with flavors of licorice and almonds. Sandrone is often seen as a modernist in the Piedmont because he opts for shorter macerations and uses some new oak in his wines. His wines are often rich but very polished."

In 1847, Gevrey annexed the name of its finest vineyard, Chambertin. These Pinot Noirs are generally deeper in color and are a little firmer than the wines of their rivals from neighboring villages. Here in the 'Homeland' of Pinot Noir it is all about the terroir. Of course there are many great, top-level wines from all over the world, but once you have the luck to drink great red Burgundy at its peak, you will never forget that experience! Joseph Drouhin is a négociant in Burgundy who produces wonderful wines for a great value."

If there are some attractive feathery fronds, set aside about 2 tablespoons of them to garnish the soup. Quarter the bulbs and trim away the stems, the bottom hard core, and any tough parts. Choose a shallow baking pan just large enough to fit the fennel in one layer and put in 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the fennel and toss until well coated. Roast the fennel until pale gold, about 20 minutes, then turn the fennel over and roast for 10 minutes longer. Stir in the broth, garlic, salt and pepper to taste, and 1/2 teaspoon of the thyme. Cover the pan with foil and cook for 35 to 45 minutes longer, or until the fennel is very soft. Remove the foil, stir, and roast for a few more minutes to evaporate most of the liquid. Transfer the fennel and garlic to a food processor and chop coarsely. Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of thyme, salt (it will need about 1 teaspoon), pepper to taste, and the fennel seeds, if using.

In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the pork, the breadcrumbs, the giblets, the chestnuts, the thyme, and the spices, working the mixture together with your fingers so it is homogeneous. As you work, the chestnuts will break into pieces — leave them in uneven pieces. Mix in the egg thoroughly with your hands, then season with salt and pepper. Sauté a teaspoon of the stuffing and taste it for seasoning. Adjust if necessary. Place as much of the stuffing as you can fit inside the capon, without packing it in too hard. Place any leftover stuffing in a baking dish."

Finally, leaving it breast up, continue to roast it until the juices of the capon run golden and the stuffing inside the bird reaches a temperature of 160°F, a total of about 2 hours, checking it occasionally to be sure that it isn't browning too much, and adding more water if the pan is dry. Remove the capon from the oven and season it liberally with salt and pepper. Turn it on its breast at an angle, so the juices run into the breast meat, and let it rest for at least 20 minutes before carving."

You want the meat to slide off the bones. Don’t be afraid of overcooking these. Ducks don’t dry out easily. The skin should be crisp. If not, no worries. You will pass the pieces under the broiler before serving. (If the ducks are too crisp and the meat is not finished cooking, cover them with foil as you continue roasting.)

Add the flour, whisking with a fork as you do so. Remove the giblets and necks from the stock reduction, and discard. Add the stock to the duck fat–flour mixture, raise the heat to medium-high, and stir continuously to prevent lumps as you bring it to a slow boil. Add the Cointreau, vinegars, orange juice, marmalade, and orange peel to the pan. Bring back to a boil, melting the marmalade, then simmer uncovered on low heat until the sauce thickens and is reduced. Preheat a broiler with the rack set a notch or two down from the top position."

Discard the orange quarters, herbs, wings, and any pockets of fat that remain. Slip the breast meat from the bones. Leave the legs intact. Put a little sauce in a broiling pan, and lay the duck pieces on top. Spoon a little sauce on top of each piece. Put them under the broiler for about 1 minute to crisp and glaze.

Remove any tomalley or eggs from tails and discard. Remove meat from shells; discard shells. Using the back of a cleaver or a lobster cracker, crack claws on all sides and pick out meat; discard shells. Cut tail and claw meat into bite-size pieces.

Transfer turkey to a cutting board and let rest at least 30 minutes before carving."
