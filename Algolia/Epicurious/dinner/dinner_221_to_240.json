Let the tamarind pulp rest until it softens, 10 to 15 minutes. Squeeze and massage the softened tamarind pulp through your fingers, loosening the fruit's soft auburn-colored pulp from the shiny black seeds, brittle brown skin shards, and sinewy bits of string.

Use 1 to 4 pieces of beef per skewer, depending on how long the pieces are, making sure that the beef extends from the tip to the middle of the skewer. Leave plenty of room so you can grab the skewer at the bottom — the meat should not extend from one end to the other."

When the fire is hot (this may take up to 20 minutes), place each skewer on the grill, making sure that the beef, not the skewer, is directly over the heat. Grill the beef until it is cooked through and has begun to pick up a few crispy brown-black spots, about 2 to 5 minutes (depending on how hot the fire is). Turn the skewers over carefully and continue grilling until the other side is browned, another 2 to 5 minutes. Do not overcook the meat — it will dry out if you do. Test a piece by touching it with your finger. The beef should be firm, not squishy. Another way to test it is by cutting into the thickest point: It should be very faintly pink, neither blood-red nor gray."

Line a half-sheet pan with aluminum foil. Place each skewer on the pan, arranging them so that the meat is in the center of the pan and the skewers slightly hang over the outside, and slide the pan into the broiler. Broil until the meat begins to turn golden brown and develops a few char spots, about 5 to 6 minutes. Turn each piece over to brown the other side, an additional 5 to 6 minutes of broiling. Test a piece by touching it with your finger. The beef should be firm, not squishy. Another way to test it is by cutting into the thickest point: It should be very faintly pink, neither blood-red nor gray. If the surface doesn't char (your broiler or the distance from the flame may not allow it to), don't worry — as long as the meat is cooked through, the satay will taste wonderful. Do not overcook the meat; it will be unpleasantly dry."

Turn off the rice cooker. The rice will look soupy, but the grains should be cooked through and firm; the creamy rice will thicken considerably as you finish the recipe.

Roast, turning regularly, until soft and browned in spots, about 10 minutes for the chiles and 15 for the garlic. Cool, slip off the garlic's husks and give it all a rough chop (no need to remove the chile seeds). In a blender or food processor, combine the garlic and chiles with 1 large bunch cilantro, 1 large bunch flat-leaf parsley, 1 cup olive oil and 2 generous teaspoons salt.

Add the capers to the pan, and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in the juice from the second half of the lemon, along with the raisins and half of the parsley. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, then check for seasoning. Remove the chicken to a board and carve as you'd like. Fluff the couscous with a fork, then arrange the cut chicken on top.

Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Take the brisket out of the refrigerator 1 hour before cooking, to bring it to room temperature. After 30 minutes, season the meat with 2 tablespoons salt."

Sear the meat on both sides, about 8 minutes per side, until it's deep golden brown. You will need to sear a portion of the meat at a time, because the entire brisket probably won't fit in the pan. To do this, leave one end of the brisket hanging off the edge of the pan, and then move that end into the pan when the other part is well seared. Once both sides are well browned, transfer the brisket to a large roasting pan that has a tight-fitting lid, or a Dutch oven."

Pour the hot stock over the meat, scraping any vegetables that have fallen on the brisket back into the liquid. The stock mixture should almost cover the brisket. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and a tight-fitting lid. Braise in the oven for 5 to 6 hours."

Wearing an apron and long heavy-duty oven mitts, use the hook that attaches to the rack to slowly lower the turkey into the oil using a stop-and-go method—slowly lower the turkey 1 to 2 inches into the oil then pull it back out a bit, repeating until the bird is fully submerged. Turn the burner back on and bring the oil to 350°F. Throughout frying, adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the 350°F oil temperature. Fry the turkey for about 3 1/2 minutes per pound. Use the hook that attaches to the rack to slowly and carefully remove the turkey from the oil and place it on a cutting board or large rimmed baking sheet. Using an instant-read thermometer, test the fleshy part of the thighs and the thickest part of the breasts (test both sides, close to but not touching the bone); the thermometer needs to register at least 165°F. If not, use the hook to slowly and carefully lower the turkey back into the oil to finish frying. Once the internal temperature reaches 165°F, transfer the turkey to a cutting board, cover with foil, and let it rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving and serving."

Sometimes (often) I do brown the chicken, sometimes use pancetta instead of prosciutto, sometimes add a little chopped tomato, sometimes introduce porcini mushrooms. If the company at dinner have dietary restrictions, oil-cured black olives can stand in for the pork. I have tried it with boneless chicken breasts only—satisfactory—and with guinea hen—excellent.\""

When the piece is coated, lay it on a clean, dry plate and repeat until all the pieces are breaded. Set aside for at least half an hour to allow the breading to set.

Wash the greens in several changes of the coldest possible water; tepid water might cause them to wilt, and you want them to stay as alert and perky as possible before being cooked. (Note: Because bok choi and baby bok choi tend to have pockets full of sand in the nooks where the leaves meet the center stem, be certain to pull the leaves back slightly away from the stem when you're cleaning them. There are few things worse than a mouthful of sand when you want a mouthful of greens.)"

If you're using baby bok choi or baby Shanghai choi, you can either leave the heads whole or cut them in half lengthwise — it's up to you. Spin the greens dry in a salad dryer or set them aside to air-dry on a kitchen towel or paper towels; they needn't be bone dry — a little dampness won't matter."

It should take 2–3 minutes for each addition to be absorbed; if things are moving faster than this, reduce heat to medium-low. Gradual absorption and constant agitation are key to encouraging starches to release from risotto, creating its trademark creamy consistency. You may not need all of the hot water, but the finished texture should be more of a liquid than a solid. Start checking rice about 15 minutes after the first water addition; the grains should be tender but not mushy, with a slightly firm center that doesn’t leave a chalky residue between your teeth after tasting. Do not overcook!"

Add thyme, garlic, and butter and cook, tossing occasionally, until garlic softens and butter is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add vinegar.
